I used to think that I am an introvert. Well, the pandemic proved me wrong. Maybe it was
because of the dramatic turn of events after the lockdown measures were implemented. I went
from seeing my friends everyday in school to not being able to meet anyone outside my
immediate family in a matter of days. 

Suddenly, I missed the hallway jokes, the cheerful lunches,
the board games and the daily height-adjusted hugs. I missed these little things that we did with
my friends. But more importantly, I missed my friends. A lot. This got me thinking about the
place of friendships in our lives.

There is this common joke that Jesus’ greatest miracle was having twelve close friends in his
thirties. There is some truth to it. As we grow older it becomes increasingly hard to make new
friends. Worse still, it also gets surprisingly easy to lose old ones. Everyone becomes so
entangled in making strides in their career and their romantic lives that cultivating friendships
takes a back seat. Friendships become a social blanket that only come in handy when one is
facing cold trouble in other aspects of their lives. Your friends become backup plans, not
intentional alliances.

But that should not be the case. We meet new people everyday in our lives. We then carefully
choose to form friendships with some and leave others as mere acquaintances. The criteria we
use to pick our friends is unique to everyone. Some prefer people with the same interests and
outlook in life. Others become friends because they live close to one another. Yet others just
want to be friends with people who look like them( a good number of my friends are
suspiciously the same height as I am). But all in all, we make a conscious decision when making
friends. We should also make a conscious decision to maintain those friendships.

So how do you maintain friendships? Again all friendships are unique and what makes them last
are peculiar to each one. But there certain things that cut across the board. Making the effort to
regularly communicate with your friends is particularly vital. Texting. Calling. Meeting up at the
local coffee shop or via Zoom. I know our lives are becoming busier as we navigate the murky
waters of young adulthood. But time is always in your control. You can prioritize what you think
adds value to your life. So, prioritize spending time connecting with your friends.

Friendships are to be nurtured. They are not accidents. They don’t just happen. They are actively
maintained. Curated. Sustained. Like all things in life sometimes friendships fail despite all our
efforts to salvage it. But that’s okay. Because we live to ‘friend’ another day.
